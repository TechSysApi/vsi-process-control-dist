  "description": "A message is a textual string giving some reasonable information to a message tracking system of the Mail Information System. The group \"Messages\" implements the messages (errors, alarms, warnings, informations) generated by a piece of mail processing equipment (MPE). The message parameters defined above are the attributes of this group. This group is defined to be a notifylist. When a new message is created, a new element of this notifylist is created. The machine has to store all messages until the message has been successfully handled by the JMS server (as any Notifylist element, this is a general mechanism for Notifylists). The storage timeframe has to be adjustable to project needs, depending on the availability of the MIS role (normally in the range of half an hour up to 3 hours). Associated to the Message Id, there must be a (language dependent) message text, which has a Java-Text like escape character notation (%1, $1) that allows the text assembly with the provided sequence of (string) parameters. Note that the numbers the escape characters start with 1and that string parameters cannot be translated, they will normally be numbers passed as strings. The interpretation is done according to the escape parameters inside the message text. The Text parameter is only displayed if no language dependent message text can be found for a given Id. The general XML mapping of this element is Messages. As this is a NotifylistElement the header will hold a timestamp that indicates when the problem occured.",
